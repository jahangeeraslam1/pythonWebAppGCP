# pythonWebAppGCP

Hello there,

I am currently exploring the capabilities of the Google Cloud Platform, after being made aware of the numerous features it offers and its ease of usage.

I have begun by watching multiple YouTube videos on the topic, as well as watching a Google seminar titled "Getting started with GCP".

## Project Developed (so far)

At the moment, the current project provides the user with authentication to log onto the platform using either an email/password combination set by the admin, or by using their Google Account. It then provides the user with a log of timestamps, which show the last 10 times they have logged into the site. Each refresh the user makes updates this log. The Google Documentation on GCP, alongside education resources are currently being used to help develop this project and to learn more about GCP.


## Whats the Update? 



**Currently working on adding more features to this site and leveraging the use of the GCP tools to examine the capability of the service. However a the moment it does seem like a very exciting technology**

Stay tuned!
